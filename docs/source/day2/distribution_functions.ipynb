    "We just revewed basic probability and random variables. If we step back and think about the random variable $x$,we can define the probability measure $P_x$ for an event $E$ in the possible event space for $x$. I won't dive too deep into the theory here, but with probability measure $P_x(E)$, we can use existing axioms of probability to find $P_x(E)$ for any interval $-\\infty<a<b<\\infty$ :\n",
