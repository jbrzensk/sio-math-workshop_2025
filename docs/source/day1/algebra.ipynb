    "- S - Subtraction  \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify an arithmetic expression using PEMDAS (see, Warm-up I), complete the mathematical operations in the order described above. To simplify an algebraic equation, apply PEMDAS in reverse order (see, Warm-up II–III). Note that the order in which the addition/subtraction operations are completed is often interchangeable. The same is true for multiplication/division. When in doubt, however, the rule is to work from left to right."
